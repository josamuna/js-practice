# Keys Points of the video

When the browser load HTML page, each element is organized as a tree like structure called _`the DOM`_.

# Tasks

Please complete the following tasks and post them on the tapaScript Discord under "40 Days of JavaScript".

> **DO NOT USE AI to FIND ANSWERS**. If you are stuck, let's discuss it on DISCORD and learn. Also, please note that none of the answers need you to create any UI. Just focus on the logic building and print the output on the browser console.

## 1. Find the Most Frequent Word in a Paragraph

Consider the follwoing HTML:

```html
<div id="text">This is a test. This test is only a test.</div>
```

Now, find and display the most frequently occurring word. Also put a count of occurance beside it.

Hints:

- Use document.querySelector() or getElementById() to select the paragraph.
- Convert the text into an array of words.
- Use querySelector() to display the most frequent word along with the count inside another `<div>`.

## 2. Create a zebra pattern

Consider the following HTML:

```html
<ul id="cars">
  <li>BMW</li>
  <li>Mahindra</li>
  <li>Audi</li>
  <li>Toyota</li>
  <li>Honda</li>
  <li>Hundai</li>
  <li>Tata</li>
  <li>Suzuki</li>
</ul>
```

Now put alternate colors and background colors to each of the list tags. for example,

- If tne BMW is in white color text, the background should be in black color.
- Then for the next car it will be reversed, the color is black and the background is white.
- Then again the next one is white color and background black
- So on.

## 3. Write different ways we can access DOM and what they returns

## 4. Find and Replace Text Inside a Page

Write a script that finds all occurrences of a word inside a `<p>` tag and replaces them with another word dynamically.

## 5. Extract and Count Unique Links from a Page

Count all the unique hyperlinks (`<a>`) in a page and display their count.
